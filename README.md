 Data normalization is generally considered the development of clean data. Diving deeper, however, the meaning or goal of data normalization is twofold:

Data normalization is the organization of data to appear similar across all records and fields.
It increases the cohesion of entry types leading to cleansing, lead generation, segmentation, and higher quality data
 Simply put, this process includes eliminating unstructured data and redundancy (duplicates) in order to ensure logical data storage. When data normalization is done correctly, you will end up with standardized information entry. For example, this process applies to how URLs, contact names, street addresses, phone numbers, and even codes are recorded. These standardized information fields can then be grouped and read swiftly.
